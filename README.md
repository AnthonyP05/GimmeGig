The inspiration in designing GimmeGig emerged from the limited amount of venues that do not specifically support and uplift local music artists here in Athens, GA. The motivation to spend time to flesh out our ideas came from the joy of seeing a local Athens band introduce themselves people who lived in the same area and never heard of the band. This project aims to create a solution that builds a community where local artists can bring their unique sounds to their fans and spread it throughout their community. 

Building GimmeGig's frontend was crafted using React, Axios, and Mongoose while programmed in Next.js. These implementations allowed the project to have an interactive and user-friendly experience. Sorting the components into two separate foolders for the Explore Page and Login Page facilitated organized code structure and simplified maintenance for future development. Using MongoDB for data storage, Auth0 for authorization, the built in Next.js routing backend required a huge time commitment from the team. Manipulating the user data between these softwares 

The journey of developing the frontend and backend simultaneously presented challenges in connecting them to the user database and addressing user interface challenges to improve the overall online experience. Troubleshooting issues related to frontend and backend development optimizing components for the user interface were crucial aspects of the challenge. This process enhanced our problem-solving skills to give each team member a list of tasks to stay productive and communicate with each other.
